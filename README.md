## Hi there, I'm Adem. ðŸ‘‹

I am Adem Khelifi, a current junior at Washington and Lee University, majoring in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science and Data Science. At Washington and Lee, I am involved in the Soccer and Basketball clubs, and I occasionally teach French to elementary school students. I love swimming, playing sports, and riding horses.
